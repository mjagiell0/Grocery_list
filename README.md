Additional project 'Shopping list' from the subject 'Object-oriented programming II'.
Functionalities:
- GUI support
- possibility of having multiple lists by one user
- possibility of maintaining one list by many users
- ability to add custom products to the list
- product filtration by categories
- list refresh function for the current list content in the database
- ability to create your own account  

I used a MySQL database. An example script for the database is located in the project under the name 'dbscript.txt'.

The GUI was created using the 'Swing GUI designer' tool in the Intellij IDEA programming environment.
